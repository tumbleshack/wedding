                    <p><b>Small Airports</b></p>
                    <p>If you're travelling to the Netherlands from somewhere within Europe, you might consider flying to Rotterdam The Hague Airport (RTM), Eindhoven Airport (EIN), or Amsterdam Airport (AMS) via budget airlines RyanAir or EasyJet. You can regularly find round-trip tickets for less than €50.</p> 
                    <p><b>Connections</b></p>
                    <p>If you choose to connect from a flight to a train, you gain the convenience of frequent schedules, almost no security lines, unlimited baggage, and getting out of the train in the middle of the city. However, be aware that if a delayed flight causes you to miss the train, the airline may only be <a href="https://www.flightright.com/your-rights/eu-regulation#when-do-i-get-compensation-according-to-eu-regulation-no-2612004">obligated to offer</a> minimal compensation, usually up to €600.</p>

                    <h3>Book Accommodations</h3>
                    <p><b>Historic Delft</b></p>
                    <p>We recommend booking accommodations inside Delft's city center, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eBTY14qEdFgnyyz8A">the "binnenstad</a>," or within walking distance thereof. You'll find many small boutique hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as a nice <a href="https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-delft/best-western-museumhotels-delft/propertyCode.92579.html">Best Western</a>. For the easiest booking experience, we recommend looking for deals using Google Maps or Booking.com (a Dutch company).</p>
                    <p><b>AirBnB & VRBO</b></p>
                    <p>Most of the Netherlands, including Delft, is in an acute housing shortage. Thus, short term rentals are in short supply. Sometimes, you can find gems on AirBnB, VRBO, or Wimdu.</p>
                    <p><b>Nearby Cities</b></p>
                    <p>Booking accommodations in a few other cities is possible. By train, you can reach Delft in 10 minutes from The Hague, 15 minutes from Rotterdam, and 1 hour from Amsterdam. Google Maps offers generally reliable public transportation advice.</p>
                    <p><b>Budget</b></p>
                    <p>In Delft, €50 to €125 per night is a fair price for a private room. If you have a tighter budget and are willing to share some facilities, <a href="https://hostelworld.com">Hostel World</a> is a great resource for finding hostels in larger Dutch cities.</p>

                    <p><b>Public Transport</b></p>
                    <p>Public Transport is king in the Netherlands. It is on time, clean, and fast. We recommend getting around with a combination of public transport plus walking or a bike rental, especially for more able-bodied people.</p>
                    <p><b>OV Chipcard</b></p>
                    <p>You can pay all public transport fares in the Netherlands with one card, the OV Chipcard (OV chipkaart), which can be bought at the desk in any train station. Fares are the same no matter when you purchase a ticket.</p>
                    <p><b>Driving</b></p>
                    <p>Parking in the Netherlands can be expensive. Furthermore, cars often have severley restricted movement in the center of cities. For these reasons, we advise against renting a car. However, if you do choose to use a car for the added simplicity and flexibility, your US Driver's License is valid in the Netherlands. See the <a href="https://nl.usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/local-resources-of-u-s-citizens/driving-in-the-netherlands/#:~:text=Tourists%20are%20allowed%20to%20drive,United%20States%20through%20the%20AAA.">US Embassy's website</a> for more information.</p>

                    <p><b>Weather</b></p>
                    <p>Average daytime temperatures range between 53° F (12° C) and 64° F (18° C). The weather is rather unpredictable and can be sunny, windy, or rainy, changing from day to day. We recommend dressing in layers and remembering to pack a rain poncho.</p>
                    <p><b>Money</b></p>
                    <p>The Netherlands uses Euros. Make sure you understand the fees associated with using your cards to pay in Euros. We recommend applying now for a travel credit card which does not charge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/credit-cards/foreign-transaction-fees/">fees above the mid-market exchange rate.</a></p>

                    <h3>Mobile Phone</h3>
                    <p>Free Wifi is widely available and easy to find. If you also want to be internet-connected on the go (helpful for navigation), you have two options.</p>
                    <p><b>Option 1: Use a Local or Regional Carrier</b></p>
                    <p>Expect to pay about $20 for 5GB of data lasting 1 month.</p>
                    <p>If your phone <a href="https://www.usmobile.com/blog/list-of-esim-compatible-devices/">is eSIM compatible</a>, the app Airalo allows you to purchase local (Dutch) or regional (pan-European) data plans. Here's <a href="https://ref.airalo.com/KX2b">a link to get you a $3 credit</a>.</p>
                    <p>If your phone is not eSIM compatible, you can buy physical SIM cards from <a href="https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/communication/mobile-telephony-netherlands">many local providers</a> in person. Make sure to ask about coverage in other EU counties if needed.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that while using the local SIM card or eSIM, you <i>cannot</i> use your American number for SMS or telephone calls. You <i>can</i> use your American number for iMessage (blue bubbles only), FaceTime, WhatsApp, or any other <a href="https://www.heymarket.com/blog/instant-messsaging-and-texting/">internet-based communication.</a></p>
                    <p><b>Option 2: Buy International Roaming from your US Carrier</b></p>
                    <p>Expect to pay about $10 per day for unlimited data.</p>
                    <p>For trips longer than 3-4 days, this option is more expensive, but involves almost no set up. You can use your American number for everything as normal.</p>
                    <p>To arrange international roaming, contact your carrier. For example, AT&T offers the <a href="https://www.att.com/international/day-pass/">International Day Pass</a> and Verizon offers <a href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/">TravelPass</a>. T-Mobile customers <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/international-roaming-plans">may have international coverage already</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Delft, Netherlands</h2>
        <p>Our first time traveling together, in the summer of 2019, we embarked on an adventure to The Netherlands. Amongst the flowers, windmills, and canals, the two of us fell in love. Since then, we lived in historic Delft, learned some Dutch, made lots of great friends, and knew we had to marry in the place so close to our hearts.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Accommodations</h2>
        <p><b>Local Travel</b></p>
        <p>Parking in Delft is expensive for visitors. Public transportation is clean, reliable, and accessible. Therefore, we advise against renting a car.</p>
        <p><b>Accommodations</b></p>
        <p>We recommend booking accommodations inside Delft's city center, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eBTY14qEdFgnyyz8A">the "binnenstad</a>," or within walking distance thereof. You'll find many small boutique hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as a nice <a href="https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-delft/best-western-museumhotels-delft/propertyCode.92579.html">Best Western</a>.</p>
        <p>Booking accommodations in a few other cities is possible. By train, you can reach Delft in 10 minutes from The Hague, 15 minutes from Rotterdam, 20 minutes from Leiden, and 1 hour from Amsterdam. Google maps offers generally reliable public transportation advice.</p>
