However, be aware that if a delayed flight causes you to miss the train, the airline may only be <a href="https://www.flightright.com/your-rights/eu-regulation#when-do-i-get-compensation-according-to-eu-regulation-no-2612004">obligated to offer</a> minimal compensation, usually up to €600.</div><!-- cgd-timeline-content --></div><div class="cgd-timeline-block animated"><div class="cgd-timeline-img"><h6>4</h6></div><!-- cgd-timeline-img --><div class="cgd-timeline-content"><h3>Book Accommodations</h3><p><b>Historic Delft</b><p>We recommend booking accommodations inside Delft's city center, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eBTY14qEdFgnyyz8A">the "binnenstad</a>," or within walking distance thereof. You'll find many small boutique hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as a nice <a href="https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-delft/best-western-museumhotels-delft/propertyCode.92579.html">Best Western</a>. For the easiest booking experience, we recommend looking for deals using Google Maps or Booking.com (a Dutch company).<p><b>AirBnB & VRBO</b><p>Most of the Netherlands, including Delft, is in an acute housing shortage. Thus, short term rentals are in short supply. Sometimes, you can find gems on AirBnB, VRBO, or Wimdu.<p><b>Nearby Cities</b><p>Booking accommodations in a few other cities is possible. By train, you can reach Delft in 10 minutes from The Hague, 15 minutes from Rotterdam, and 1 hour from Amsterdam. Google Maps offers generally reliable public transportation advice.<p><b>Budget</b><p>In Delft, €50 to €125 per night is a fair price for a private room.

It is on time, clean, and fast. We recommend getting around with a combination of public transport plus walking or a bike rental, especially for more able-bodied people.<p><b>OV Chipcard</b><p>You can pay all public transport fares in the Netherlands with one card, the OV Chipcard (OV chipkaart), which can be bought at the desk in any train station. Fares are the same no matter when you purchase a ticket.<p><b>Driving</b><p>Parking in the Netherlands can be expensive. Furthermore, cars often have severley restricted movement in the center of cities. For these reasons, we advise against renting a car. However, if you do choose to use a car for the added simplicity and flexibility, your US Driver's License is valid in the Netherlands.

The weather is rather unpredictable and can be sunny, windy, or rainy, changing from day to day. We recommend dressing in layers and remembering to pack a rain poncho. We recommend <a href="https://www.buienradar.nl/weer/delft/nl/2757345">Buienradar</a> (Dutch only) for checking the forcast.<p><b>Money</b><p>The Netherlands uses Euros.

If you also want to be internet-connected on the go (helpful for navigation), you have two options.<p><b>Option 1: Use a Local or Regional Carrier</b><p>Expect to pay about $20 for 5GB of data lasting 1 month.<p>This option will only work if your phone is unlocked. Contact your current carrier to find out if it's locked.<p>If your phone <a href="https://www.usmobile.com/blog/list-of-esim-compatible-devices/">is eSIM compatible</a>, the app Airalo allows you to purchase local (Dutch) or regional (pan-European) data plans. Here's <a href="https://ref.airalo.com/KX2b">a link to get you a $3 credit</a>.<p>If your phone is not eSIM compatible, you can buy physical SIM cards from <a href="https://www.iamexpat.nl/expat-info/communication/mobile-telephony-netherlands">many local providers</a> in person. Make sure to ask about coverage in other EU counties if needed.<p>Keep in mind that while using the foreign SIM or eSIM card, you <i>cannot</i> use your American number for SMS or telephone calls. You <i>can</i> use your American number for iMessage (blue bubbles only), FaceTime, WhatsApp, or any other <a href="https://www.heymarket.com/blog/instant-messsaging-and-texting/">internet-based communication.</a><p><b>Option 2: Buy International Roaming from your US Carrier</b><p>Expect to pay about $10 per day for unlimited data.<p>For trips longer than 3-4 days, this option is more expensive, but involves almost no set up. You can use your American number for everything as normal.<p>To arrange international roaming, contact your carrier. For example, AT&T offers the <a href="https://www.att.com/international/day-pass/">International Day Pass</a> and Verizon offers <a href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/">TravelPass</a>.
