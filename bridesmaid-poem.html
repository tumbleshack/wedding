I were little we were never far apart,<br> At primary school &amp; Girls’ Brigade or talking about boys in the park.<br> Then there was Sunday School, Duke of Ed &amp; working in the pub,<br> Or just sitting in Shirley’s drinking tea &amp; eating all her grub.<p>The last few years we’ve had to travel further for the same,<br> Often involving buses, taxis, trains &amp; even planes.<br> Thankfully now we’ve seen the light &amp; both moved back to Belfast,<br> So Prosecco Fridays can be a regular thing at last.<p>It didn’t seem to matter that I was late to join the scene<br> Starting my first job in the bar Gillian took me under her wing<br> Working with her here was a laugh but it’s not where our friendship grew<br> That only really happened when she joined the Down High crew.<p>Being in different years was a pain &amp; so was being apart daily until noon<br> So we spent our days thinking of ways to sneak her into my common room.<br> &amp; although I met Gillian late on in my teens I feel like I’ve known her forever<br> She’s my ‘go to’ for advice, she’ll say what she thinks &amp; damn it she’s actually quite clever!<p>She tried out being a waitress but, to be honest, she wasn’t great,<br> Oh yes, she had the charisma, but she could only ever carry one plate.<br> Those little hands were made for more delicate work it would seem,<br> Which is why London City bankers are walking around with teeth agleam.<p>Aside from teeth, Gillian would be prone to a spot of cleaning,<br> In fact, Barry’s probably learned that there’s no point in intervening.<br> For when Gillian gets her marigolds on &amp; decides to do a clear out,<br> You’re better off heading to the garden, &amp; en route, getting a beer out.<p>These days, our nights out are relatively tame<br> But back in our teens it was a rather different game<br> Primed with White Zinfandel we’d head to the Odyssey<br> Where we’d tear up the dance floor to Snoop D-O-double G<p>One thing that hasn’t changed is that before we go to bed<br> We kick off our dancing shoes &amp; curl up with Father Ted<br> A mug of tea &amp; a slice of toast go well with egg in a cup<br> &amp; what do you know, we’re away to bed &amp; we’re half way sobered up.<p>Sunday school excursions used to be an annual event,<br> Mars bar sandwiches on the way to Portrush, then off to Barry’s we went.<br> You see, she always did have a thing for Barrys, but back then we never knew,<br> That she would fall for a big ginger Armagh boy &amp; end up saying ‘I do’.<p>Which brings us on to Mr McGee, who we both quite literally look up to,<br> He’s handsome, charming, intelligent &amp; even quite funny, if you’ve had a few.<br> Joking aside, it’s a thumbs up from us, we think you’re one in a million,<br> And, most importantly, you’re perfect for our wee Gillian.<p>So thank you both for giving us this honour at your wedding,<br> Hopefully we haven’t brought up anything you were dreading.<br> Instead we’ve tried to illustrate just how many good times we’ve had,<br> &amp; look forward to all those ahead, when you’ll hopefully be ‘Mum &amp; Dad!’<p>So to finish off we ask you all to stand &amp; raise a toast...<br> To Gillian &amp; Barry, the couple we love the most!<p>😍</div></div></section></div><div class="wrapper"><footer class="footer row"><div class="footer__left"><p>Created by us.
