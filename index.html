        <h2 class="section__header">Day-Of Details</h2>
        <p><b>Ceremony Venue</b></p>
        <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/woS5bVqA4rjNueQ17">The Lutherse Kerk</a> was constructed in 1768 by Nicolaas Terburgh, retrofitted from the building's previous purpose as a municipal armory. Prior to being an armory, the site hosted a church from the fifteenth century.</p>
        <p>The ceremony will begin at 4:15 in the afternoon, and will last approximately 45 minutes. At the conclusion of the ceremony, light refreshments will be provided in the church. Weather permitting, guests will have a photo opportunity in the church's charming surroundings.</p>
        <p><b>Dinner and Dancing Venue</b></p>
        <p>A bit after 6:00, we'll depart for <a href="https://www.bijharry.com/">Bij Harry</a>. The 10 minute walk will follow the Oude Delft canal and take us past historic monuments, such as the Musuem Prinsenhof and the leaning Oude Jan church.</p>
        <p><b>Dress Code</b></p>
        <p>Our ceremony and dinner will be semi-formal.</p>
        <p><b>Gifts & Registry</b></p>
        <p>Understanding the massive effort involved in crossing an ocean to celebrate with us, your presence is the best gift of all. Plus, we plan to travel light for the honeymoon, so save some room in your bags and don’t bring a gift.</p>
        <p>If you’ve already made plans for a gift, please reach out to us directly.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Bonus Activities</h2>
        <p><b>Keukenhof - 14 May</b></p>
        <p>Each spring, the Keukenhof plants seven million flower bulbs across nearly eighty acres of land. The garden is one of the world's largest, and it's a lovely way to experience the Dutch flowers.</p>
        <p>Feel free to join us at the Keukenhof on Sunday morning. We'll depart Delft together at 9:30 A.M. After spending the day admiring the garden, we'll return to Delft in the mid afternoon. Please <a href="#rsvp">complete the RSVP</a> as soon as possible if you'd like us to get you a ticket – they do sell out.</p>
        <p><b>Drop-in Brunch - 16 May</b></p>
        <p>We're hosting a drop-in brunch for anyone who would like to join on the day after our wedding. Once a location in Delft has been finalized, you can find it here. Some typical Dutch breakfast items will be available, such as hagel slag and cheese.</p>
        <p><b>Atmosphere</b></p>
        <p>Both bonus activities will be casual.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Accommodations</h2>
        <p><b>Local Travel</b></p>
        <p>Parking in Delft is expensive for visitors. Public transportation is clean, reliable, and accessible. Therefore, we advise against renting a car.</p>
        <p><b>Accommodations</b></p>
        <p>We recommend booking accommodations inside Delft's city center, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eBTY14qEdFgnyyz8A">the "binnenstad</a>," or within walking distance thereof. You'll find many small boutique hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as a nice <a href="https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-delft/best-western-museumhotels-delft/propertyCode.92579.html">Best Western</a>.</p>
        <p>Booking accommodations in a few other cities is possible. By train, you can reach Delft in 10 minutes from The Hague, 15 minutes from Rotterdam, and 1 hour from Amsterdam. Google Maps offers generally reliable public transportation advice.</p>
