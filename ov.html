                    <!-- <h4 class="cgd-date for-small">Afternoon of 15 May</h4> -->
                    <p><b>Use the NS App</b></p>
                    <p>Choose "Schipol Airport" station as the “from”, and Delft station as the “to." Make sure you see a train icon next to the name of the station; otherwise, the app will try to give you unhelpful walking directions.</p>
                    <p><b>Trip Details</b></p>
                    <p>Click on one of the offered trips to see the details: departure platform number, the travel time, the cost, and any required transfers.</p>
                    <p>Keep in mind that Europeans write dates with the day first: DD/MM/YY.</p>
                    <p><b>Transfers</b></p>
                    <p>Some trips include transfers. Do not stress. Trains to Delft run frequently. If you miss the transfer, ask a kind stranger for help, and they'll point you to the next train.</p>
                    <p><b>Leiden Transfer</b></p>
                    <p>If your chosen trip includes a 2 minute transfer in Leiden, get off one train and walk across the platform to the next train. Do not go downstairs.</p>
                    <p><b>Google and Apple Maps</b></p>
                    <p>Google and Apple maps offer up-to-date, reliable public transit advice. If you prefer to use these instead of the NS app, you can. Keep in mind that the NS app and departure boards in the station are the source of truth.</p>

                    <h3>Paying for your Trip</h3>
                    <p>You have a few options for paying for your train journey.</p>
                    <p><b>Recommended Option: Credit or Debit Card</b></p>
                    <p>Just like in New York or London, you can check in and out of all public transit using your tap-able debit or credit card. Apple Pay will also work.</p>
                    <p>At Schiphol, find one of the check in poles (they look <a href="https://www.icreatemagazine.nl/app/uploads/2016/08/incheckpaal-ov.jpg">like this</a>) and tap your credit/debit card to check in. You are now ready to ride the train.</p>
                    <p>Only one passenger can use a given card. If a train conductor asks to see your ticket, simply present the card you used.</p>
                    <p><b>Option 2: Online e-Ticket</b></p>
                    <p>In the Dutch railways NS app, once finding a trip, you can buy the e-ticket. You can use the e-ticket for any schedule on the chosen day as long as your price paid matches the cost of the specific train you select. If you have an e-Ticket, check in and out are not necessary.</p>
                    <p><b>Option 3: Buy a Public Transit Card (OV Chipcard)</b></p>
                    <p>At the ticket counters, you can buy a temporary (blue) OV Chipcard. You can load this chipcard with a chosen Euro amount. At Schiphol, find one of the check in poles (they look <a href="https://www.icreatemagazine.nl/app/uploads/2016/08/incheckpaal-ov.jpg">like this</a>) and tap your OV Chipcard to check in. You are now ready to ride the train.</p>
                    <p><b>Ticket Prices are Fixed</b></p>
                    <p>For a given time of day, the price of a journey between two locations is always the same, no matter when you buy your ticket or which yellow train you take (if the train is red, do not ride it without a ticket). Journeys which begin during peak hours on weekdays, from 6:30 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM, cost about 40% more.</p>
                    <p><b>Always Check In AND Check Out</b></p>
                    <p>On all Dutch public transit, no matter your method of payment, you must ALWAYS check both in and out.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Delft, Netherlands</h2>
        <p>Our first time traveling together, in the summer of 2019, we embarked on an adventure to The Netherlands. Amongst the flowers, windmills, and canals, the two of us fell in love. Since then, we lived in historic Delft, learned some Dutch, made lots of great friends, and knew we had to marry in the place so close to our hearts.</p>

        <h2 class="section__header">Accommodations</h2>
        <p><b>Local Travel</b></p>
        <p>Parking in Delft is expensive for visitors. Public transportation is clean, reliable, and accessible. Therefore, we advise against renting a car.</p>
        <p><b>Accommodations</b></p>
        <p>We recommend booking accommodations inside Delft's city center, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/eBTY14qEdFgnyyz8A">the "binnenstad</a>," or within walking distance thereof. You'll find many small boutique hotels and bed and breakfasts, as well as a nice <a href="https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/book/hotels-in-delft/best-western-museumhotels-delft/propertyCode.92579.html">Best Western</a>.</p>
        <p>Booking accommodations in a few other cities is possible. By train, you can reach Delft in 10 minutes from The Hague, 15 minutes from Rotterdam, 20 minutes from Leiden, and 1 hour from Amsterdam. Google maps offers generally reliable public transportation advice.</p>
